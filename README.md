How to create a grouped bar chart with Flask, on localhost

Built with MySQL 5.6, Python 3, Flask 0.12.2, etc. (pandas, sqlalchemy...).

Has test database and the code to display the chart. Modified from original, may require a bit of work to get running. Like, you need to know to create 'static' and 'templates' folders, get C3.js and D3.js version 3 and put them into static, etc.
